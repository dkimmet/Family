## 24. Disc Golf

[Disc golf courses](http://www.discgolfcolumbus.com/courses/overview.htm)

- Lobdell Reserve. Big shot opportunities in a beautiful, quiet area.

- Brent Hambrick. Lots of big tournaments here, shorts are good for a par 3 challenge and longs are harder.

- Caesar Ford park - maybe my favorite course in the area. About an hour away though. Big, good mix of woods and open, challenging course. Adding on to this, echo valley is also an elite course but it adds 20 min of driving

- Alum Creek state park. I think this course has a lot of potential. Also a beautiful area, just could use some work. always have a good time there, but it can get itchy with bugs and plants though.

- simsbury. A fun course with a slightly confusing layout. The rough is horrible and it’s easy to lose a disc, but I enjoy this one a lot.

- blendon woods if you want to work on your putter woods shots and Griggs reservoir if you need to test out some discs in an open field. both not my favorites but good for practice and pretty close by.

- another far drive (~45 min), but flat rocks and eagles nest in Lancaster are both solid

- veterans memorial and Scioto grove are serviceable but I’d hit the other ones first
